FitIt
=====

#### Description ####

FitIt is a browsergame that was originally created on ADVANCE Hackathon 2012 in Cologne, Germany as a small project by [@rattazong](http://twitter.com/rattazong), [@snnd](http://twitter.com/snnd) and [@newmetl](http://twitter.com/newmetl). 

It is based on the board game "Ubongo" - the object of the game is to fit your gaming piece into the highlighted area, together with the gaming piece of the other players. The trick: You are not able to talk to the other players.


#### Technics ####

Backend is done with node.js, socket.io and express.js. Frontend is done with HTML5 + Canvas, Jade as a templating language and Stylus for CSS. All the JavaScript is written with CoffeeScript.


#### Setup instructions ####

* Install node.js
* Use `npm install` to install the needed modules
* Make sure you have CoffeeScript installed globally (using `npm install -g coffee-script`)
* Run the server using `coffee ./index.coffee`
